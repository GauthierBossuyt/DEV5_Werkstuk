<center><h1> The Resonating API </h1></center>


## Description :memo:

This is a project for my course Multimedia & Creative Technologies at the Erasmus University College Brussels. I am asked to develop an **[open source API](https://expressjs.com/)**, that uses a **[database](https://knexjs.org/)**. The subject for this project was a Jukebox site using the API to store its users and songs.

## Relevance :+1:

For me it's relevant not to only learn how to make an API, that uses a database, but also because I can experiment with different technologies, such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),[ knex.js](https://knexjs.org), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), ... . I hope this can be used as a basic setup or as a tutorial for people who also want to learn those technologies.

## Getting Started :rocket:

A step-by-step guide to launch my project.

1. Start by creating an .env file, based on the .example-env file.
2. Check if the docker-compose.yml & Dockerfile fits your needs.
3. Open a command prompt and make sure the path links to the projects folder. Use the next command to build and run the docker container: `docker-compose up --build`.


## Roadmap :round_pushpin:
